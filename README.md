# vue-adug
This project was buit as a demonstration of building a web application using the Vue 2 framework. This was presented to the Canberra Delphi Users Group in June 2020. The recording of this presentation can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_A391Txll8

There have been many updates and upgrades to the libraries used in this project since it was released. Obviously this code is not suitable for production.

This project was originally set up using npm however, due to its inability to resolve package dependancy conflicts that now exist, I have updated the instructions to use the Yarn package manager.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
Note that this project is not recommended for any production deployment, but this is the step you'd take to deploy a production application. The output from this command are the files generated in the ./dist folder.
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
